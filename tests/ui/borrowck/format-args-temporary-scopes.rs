fn temp() {}

    // dropped after evaluating `&temp()`.

    // In Rust 1.89, `format_args!` extended the lifetime of all extending expressions in its
    // arguments when provided with two or more arguments. This caused the result of `temp()` to
    // outlive the result of the block, making this compile.

    // In real-world projects, this typically appeared in `if` expressions with a `&str` in one
    // branch and a reference to a `String` temporary in the other. Since the consequent and `else`
    // blocks of `if` expressions are temporary scopes in all editions, this affects Rust 2021 and
    // earlier as well.
